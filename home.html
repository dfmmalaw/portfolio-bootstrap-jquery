            Hi! My name is Dean Friedland and I am a developer. I have an incredible 
            wife (Ashley), daughter (Reese), and son (Ryder), and there is nothing 
            better than being a husband and father. I love all things martial arts 
            and will train and compete in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu until the day I die! 
            I also love to surf and have saltwater in my veins. I live in Kennesaw, 
            Georgia and the closest beach is hours away, which I hate :)
            </p>

            <p class="about2">
            I am originally from South Africa but have lived in the US since I was 
            a kid, after a six year stint in Canada. I have also lived in both Ecuador 
            and Costa Rica (both of which have killer waves) and am blessed to have 
            traveled to many other countries in this amazing world. I hope you enjoy 
            my site and thank you for visiting!
            </p>
